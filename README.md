Libasm
Reimplemented several standard C library functions using x86-64 Assembly (NASM) to deepen understanding of low-level programming, memory manipulation, and CPU instructions.
Functions include strlen, strcpy, strcmp, write, read, and strdup, tested via custom test suite and comparison with libc behavior.
