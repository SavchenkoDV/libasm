Libasm
Reimplemented several standard C library functions using x86-64 Assembly (NASM) to deepen understanding of low-level programming, memory manipulation, and CPU instructions.
Functions include strlen, strcpy, strcmp, write, read, and strdup, tested via custom test suite and comparison with libc behavior.

After cloning the repository, type make at the command line. A test file will appear, so you can test the functionality of the functions.
